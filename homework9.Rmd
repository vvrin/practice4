```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)

av <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/avengers/avengers.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
av

deaths <- av %>%
  gather(key = "Time", value = "Death", 11 : 20) %>%
  mutate(Time = parse_number(Time),
         Death = if_else(Death == "", "NO", Death))

print(deaths)
```

(Vrindha) They are shown or directly implied to be killed --> Too see if they were killed, I used the contain function to find the word die in the Notes. if it did exist, I could see who it was correlated to. This would allow me to see who was implied to be killed.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
filter_death -> df %>% contains(Notes, die)
```
